# Sensor Log Combiner and Timestamp Formatter

This repository provides a lightweight C and Python toolchain for combining and formatting sensor or log data stored in `.txt` files. It's ideal for preprocessing time-series data collected from embedded systems or sensor devices before analysis or visualization.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- **combine_text_file.c**  
  A C program that scans a directory, finds `.TXT` or `.txt` files, reorders them based on filename patterns, and merges them into a single output file.

- **file_testing.py**  
  A Python script that modifies the first field (e.g., timestamp) in each line of the combined file using a custom numerical time increment format.

- **file_testing_modify.py**  
  An enhanced Python script that reformats the timestamp into a structured, human-readable format (`dd,hh:mm:ss`) while preserving sensor values.

---

## ðŸ›  How to Use

### 1. **Combine Files**
Compile and run the C program to combine `.txt` files from a directory.

```bash
gcc combine_text_file.c -o combine
./combine
```
Edit the hardcoded path[] in the source file to your actual folder path.

2. Format Timestamps
After generating the combined file, run either of the following:

âž¤ Basic Time Increment
```bash
python file_testing.py
```

âž¤ Human-Readable Format
```bash
python file_testing_modify.py
```
Both scripts will ask for a numeric start time (e.g., hhmmss) and generate a modified .txt output.

ðŸ“‚ Example Output
Before

```bash
time=3000000, sensor1=12, sensor2=25,...
```
After (file_testing_modify.py)

```bash
30,00:00:01,12,25,...
```
ðŸ”§ Requirements
C compiler (e.g., GCC)

Python 3.x

ðŸ“Œ Notes
File ordering is based on specific characters in filenames (e.g., xxxx000.txt, xxxx001.txt, etc.).

You can adjust the formatting logic to match your sensor data format.
